# Knowledge and Data Project
Design and implement a compelling, cool, spiffy and useful data analysis pipeline that takes full advantage of the technology taught in the Knowledge & Data course. Document the process that led to the implementation, and present the result. Pick a domain, think of an interesting problem that would benefit from a semantics-informed data analysis.
# Chosen Topic: skincare ontology
The objective of this analysis is to provide insight into the complex sphere of
skincare by providing users with personalized routines that will enhance the
health of their facial skin. The designed system will present the most suitable
products based on individual input parameters. Users will provide the system
with information about their skin type, skin tone, residential country, and desired
complexity of the overall routine.
